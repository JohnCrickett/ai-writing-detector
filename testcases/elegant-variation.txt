Vierny, after a visit in Moscow in the early 1970's, committed to supporting artists resisting the constraints of socialist realism and discovered Yankilevskly, among others such as Ilya Kabakov and Erik Bulatov. In the challenging climate of Soviet artistic constraints, Yankilevsky, alongside other non-conformist artists, faced obstacles in expressing their creativity freely. Dina Vierny, recognizing the immense talent and the struggle these artists endured, played a pivotal role in aiding their artistic aspirations. 

In this new chapter of his life, Yankilevsky found himself amidst a community of like-minded artists who, despite diverse styles, shared a common goal—to break free from the confines of state-imposed artistic norms, particularly socialist realism. 

The move to Paris facilitated an environment where Yankilevsky could further explore and exhibit his distinctive artistic vision without the constraints imposed by the Soviet regime. Dina Vierny's unwavering support and commitment to the Russian avant-garde artists played a crucial role in fostering a space where their creativity could flourish, contributing to the rich tapestry of artistic expression in the vibrant cultural landscape of Paris. Vierny's commitment culminated in the groundbreaking exhibition "Russian Avant-Garde - Moscow 1973" at her Saint-Germain-des-Prés gallery, showcasing the diverse yet united front of non-conformist artists challenging the artistic norms of their time.
