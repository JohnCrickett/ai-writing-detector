The old oak tree stood tall against the darkening sky, its branches reaching out like skeletal
fingers grasping for the last remnants of twilight. Silence draped over the valley, broken
only by the occasional rustle of dry leaves dancing across the frozen ground. It was a
lonely place, yet it felt alive with the memories of a thousand winters past. Every
creak of the wood seemed to whisper a secret that the wind was too hurried to carry.

The tree is very tall. The sky is very dark. The branches are like fingers. The valley
is very quiet. The leaves move on the ground. The place is very lonely. The place
is very alive. The wood makes a sound. The wind moves very fast. The tree is old.
The sky is dark. The valley is quiet.
